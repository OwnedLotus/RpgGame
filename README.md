# RpgGame
 A rpg text game built in java. This is mainly for just messing around in a different language than I am used to. 
 It will not be the premium quality code of a mass produced game, or even that which has a lot of time placed into it.
 I plan on inconsistanly updating the game every so often but I have more important projects to work on for the future.
